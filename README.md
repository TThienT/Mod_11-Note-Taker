## Description

Note Taker is an application designed for users to write, store, and delete notes. This project serves as a personal challenge to showcase my proficiency in developing both the backend and frontend components of a website. By successfully integrating Node and Express.js, I aim to demonstrate my skills in full-stack coding. Additionally, this endeavor provides an opportunity for me to enhance my proficiency with Insomnia, a testing tool, and further refine my abilities in Node and Express.js.
